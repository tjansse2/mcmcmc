README - interfaces

purpose
#######

The interface is used as the link between the store format
of the data  and the test environment.

features
########

An interface has to provide a class with three funktions:


getSamples(path)
****************

This funktion takes the path to the directory where the
data is stored as argument and returns a numpy structued
array with has to have at lest two fields:

  1. sample : witch contains the path to a single data file.
  2. size   : witch contains the number of entrys of the 
              corresponding data file.

There can be additional fileds e.g. for the generator
configuration.

getReference(path)
******************

Similar to the "getSamples" funktion but takes the path to
only one data file.
It should return a dictonary with provides the same 
information as the filds of the structued array
in "getSamples".
In contrast to getSamples the entry "sample" should not 
contain the path but the loaded data in form of an array

load(path)
**********
This funktion is used to load the data from the paths
in the field "sample"
It should return an array with the data.
e.g. if the data is stored in numpy binary files (npy)
the funktion could just return np.load(path)
